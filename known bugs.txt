language bugs:
- need for doing a first dummy allocation, for the rest to work (at engine/main.liz:main())
- unary operators dont work within scope without curly (ex: if a > 0 *ptr = 0;)
- structures derived from using dont seem to work with operator overloading
ex:	draw.{
		pos = cam_pos;
	};
this one doesnt work, with pos and cam_pos being v3

game bugs:
- character speed is inconsistent between release and build mode
